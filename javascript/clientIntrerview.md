Here’s a simple Q&A format based on your topics, along with some technical practice ideas to help you prepare for your interview:

---

### Q&A

**1. What is MVC architecture? Explain more on MVC.**  
- **Answer:** MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. It’s a design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components:
  - **Model:** Manages the data and business logic.
  - **View:** Displays the data to the user.
  - **Controller:** Handles user input and updates the Model and View accordingly.
- **Practice:** Describe a simple web application using MVC. For example, how a blog application would separate its functionalities into these three parts.

---

**2. What are the benefits of using React?**  
- **Answer:** React provides:
  - Reusable components, which increase efficiency.
  - Virtual DOM for improved performance.
  - Unidirectional data flow for better control.
  - Strong community support and rich ecosystem.
- **Practice:** Build a simple React component (e.g., a button) and demonstrate its reusability.

---

**3. What are the advantages of Single Page Applications (SPA)?**  
- **Answer:** SPAs offer:
  - Faster loading times since only necessary data is loaded.
  - Improved user experience with smooth transitions.
  - Reduced server load due to fewer requests.
- **Practice:** Create a simple SPA using HTML and JavaScript that demonstrates page transitions.

---

**4. How do you manage state management in React when working with large applications?**  
- **Answer:** For large applications, state management can be handled using:
  - Context API for global state management.
  - Redux for predictable state management with actions and reducers.
  - MobX for more reactive programming.
- **Practice:** Set up a simple React application that uses Redux for state management.

---

**5. Have you worked with Azure Functions?**  
- **Answer:** Yes, I have worked with Azure Functions to create serverless applications, which allow me to run code in response to events without managing servers.
- **Practice:** Create a simple Azure Function that responds to HTTP requests.

---

**6. Have you developed or consumed APIs?**  
- **Answer:** Yes, I have developed RESTful APIs and consumed APIs in my applications to interact with backend services.
- **Practice:** Build a simple Express.js API and consume it with a frontend application.

---

**7. Do you have experience with design tools?**  
- **Answer:** Yes, I have experience using Figma and Photoshop for UI/UX design.
- **Practice:** Create a simple wireframe in Figma for a webpage layout.

---

**8. Are you interested only in frontend development, or are you also interested in backend development?**  
- **Answer:** I am interested in both frontend and backend development and eager to learn more about backend technologies.
  
---

**9. How do you load web components in a Single Page Application?**  
- **Answer:** Web components can be loaded using JavaScript frameworks/libraries or by importing them as custom elements.
- **Practice:** Create a simple web component and demonstrate how to use it in a SPA.

---

**10. What is the difference between web components and design components?**  
- **Answer:** Web components are reusable UI elements built using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS), while design components refer to UI elements designed for aesthetic purposes, often in design tools.
  
---

**11. Do you have experience in Azure DevOps?**  
- **Answer:** Yes, I have experience with Azure DevOps for managing project workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and collaboration.
  
---

**12. What are the benefits of web components?**  
- **Answer:** Benefits include:
  - Encapsulation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - Reusability across different applications.
  - Improved maintainability.
  
---

**13. What were your roles and responsibilities in your previous projects?**  
- **Answer:** My roles included:
  - Developing frontend applications using React.
  - Collaborating with design and backend teams.
  - Implementing state management solutions.
  - Ensuring code quality through testing and reviews.

By preparing these questions and practicing the related technical skills, you'll be well-equipped for your client interview!

Here’s a practice set of coding challenges along with their solutions. These challenges will help you prepare for your interview by focusing on JavaScript, React, and general programming concepts.

### Practice Set

#### Challenge 1: FizzBuzz
**Problem:** Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five print "Buzz." For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz."

**Solution:**
```javascript
function fizzBuzz() {
    for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
        if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
            console.log("FizzBuzz");
        } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
            console.log("Fizz");
        } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
            console.log("Buzz");
        } else {
            console.log(i);
        }
    }
}

fizzBuzz();
```

---

#### Challenge 2: Reverse a String
**Problem:** Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.

**Solution:**
```javascript
function reverseString(str) {
    return str.split('').reverse().join('');
}

console.log(reverseString("hello")); // Output: "olleh"
```

---

#### Challenge 3: Palindrome Check
**Problem:** Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (it reads the same backward as forward).

**Solution:**
```javascript
function isPalindrome(str) {
    const cleanedStr = str.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, '').toLowerCase();
    return cleanedStr === cleanedStr.split('').reverse().join('');
}
