Handling cross-questions on these JavaScript problems requires both a clear understanding of the underlying logic and the ability to explain it in simple terms. Here are some common cross-questions you might face and how you can respond effectively:

### 1. **Palindrome Check**

**Question:**  
*Why are you using `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods to check if a string is a palindrome?*

**Answer:**  
These methods help me reverse the string easily:
- `split('')` converts the string into an array of characters.
- `reverse()` reverses that array.
- `join('')` converts the array back into a string.  
Finally, I compare the reversed string with the original one to see if they are identical, which indicates a palindrome.

### 2. **Fibonacci Sequence**

**Question:**  
*Why do you start the Fibonacci sequence array with `[0, 1]`?*

**Answer:**  
The Fibonacci sequence begins with 0 and 1 by definition. Every subsequent number in the sequence is the sum of the two preceding ones, so it's essential to initialize the array with the first two numbers as `[0, 1]`.

### 3. **Prime Number Check**

**Question:**  
*Why do you stop checking divisibility at `num-1`? Isn't there a more efficient way?*

**Answer:**  
Yes, the approach can be optimized. Instead of checking up to `num-1`, I could stop at `Math.sqrt(num)` because any factor larger than the square root would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root. This would reduce the number of iterations.

### 4. **Factorial Calculation**

**Question:**  
*Why did you use recursion for calculating factorial? Is there a better way?*

**Answer:**  
Recursion is a natural fit for factorials because the factorial of `n` is `n * factorial(n-1)`. However, in cases where performance or memory usage is critical, an iterative solution would be better since recursion could lead to a stack overflow for large inputs.

**Iterative Solution:**

```javascript
function factorial(n) {
  let result = 1;
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    result *= i;
  }
  return result;
}
```

### 5. **Find the Largest Number in an Array**

**Question:**  
*Why did you use `Math.max(...arr)` instead of iterating through the array?*

**Answer:**  
Using `Math.max(...arr)` is a concise and efficient way to find the largest element, but it comes with a small performance cost for very large arrays since the spread operator `...` has to expand the entire array. An alternative approach could be using a loop to find the maximum, especially for performance-critical code.

### 6. **Reverse Words in a String**

**Question:**  
*Why use `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` to reverse the words?*

**Answer:**  
These methods provide a clean, readable solution:
- `split(' ')` breaks the string into words.
- `reverse()` reverses the order of those words.
- `join(' ')` combines them back into a single string.  
This approach is simple and leverages built-in methods for efficiency.

### 7. **Sum of Array Elements**

**Question:**  
*What’s the advantage of using `reduce()` to sum array elements?*

**Answer:**  
`reduce()` is a functional programming technique that eliminates the need for explicit loops. It’s more declarative and flexible because it allows me to perform accumulations in a single line of code. It can also be easily adapted to other operations, like multiplication.

### 8. **Find Duplicates in an Array**

**Question:**  
*Why are you sorting the array first to find duplicates? Isn’t there a better way?*

**Answer:**  
Sorting simplifies the comparison process since duplicates will be adjacent, making it easier to detect them in a single pass. However, a more efficient method would be using a `Set` to keep track of seen elements and identify duplicates in one pass without sorting.

**Using a Set:**

```javascript
function findDuplicates(arr) {
  let seen = new Set();
  let duplicates = new Set();
  
  arr.forEach(num => {
    if (seen.has(num)) {
      duplicates.add(num);
    }
    seen.add(num);
  });

  return [...duplicates];
}
```

### 9. **FizzBuzz**

**Question:**  
*Why did you check for `i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0` before the individual checks?*

**Answer:**  
If we don’t check for divisibility by both 3 and 5 first, it would match one of the individual conditions first (for example, if `i` is 15, it would just print "Fizz" instead of "FizzBuzz"). So, to avoid that, the combined condition needs to be checked before the others.

---

### 10. **Remove Duplicates from Array**

**Question:**  
*What is the advantage of using `Set` to remove duplicates over loops?*

**Answer:**  
A `Set` inherently holds only unique values, so it automatically removes duplicates when you pass an array into it. This is faster and cleaner than manually iterating over the array to filter out duplicates.

### General Tips for Handling Cross-Questions:
- **Explain Clearly**: Use simple, non-technical language to explain your thought process.
- **Prepare Alternatives**: Be ready with optimized or alternative solutions.
- **Acknowledge Limitations**: If your approach has limitations, mention them and suggest ways to improve.
- **Stay Calm**: If you don’t know the answer, it’s fine to say you’ll research it and get back with a better solution.
