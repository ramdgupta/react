Here are additional JavaScript topics with real-life examples that will help broaden your understanding:

### 1. **Closures**
**Real-Life Example:**
Imagine you run a bank. A customer creates an account, and you want to keep track of their balance. Each time they deposit or withdraw money, you need to update and return the balance. Closures allow you to keep the balance private but still provide methods to modify it.

```javascript
function createAccount() {
  let balance = 0;

  return {
    deposit: function(amount) {
      balance += amount;
      return `Balance: ${balance}`;
    },
    withdraw: function(amount) {
      balance -= amount;
      return `Balance: ${balance}`;
    }
  };
}

const account = createAccount();
console.log(account.deposit(100));  // Balance: 100
console.log(account.withdraw(50));  // Balance: 50
```

### 2. **Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises and Async/Await)**
**Real-Life Example:**
You want to fetch weather data from an API and display it on your website. Since network requests take time, you don’t want to block the UI. You can use Promises or `async/await` to handle the asynchronous nature of the network request.

```javascript
// Using async/await
async function getWeather(city) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.weather.com/${city}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(`Temperature in ${city}: ${data.temperature}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching weather data", error);
  }
}

getWeather("New York");
```

### 3. **Event Handling**
**Real-Life Example:**
You’re building an online form where users enter data. When they click the “Submit” button, you need to validate the form and prevent it from submitting if any fields are missing.

```javascript
document.getElementById('submitBtn').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  const name = document.getElementById('name').value;
  if (!name) {
    event.preventDefault(); // Prevent form submission
    alert('Name is required');
  }
});
```

### 4. **Debouncing**
**Real-Life Example:**
You’re implementing a search feature where users type into a search bar, and results are shown in real-time. To avoid sending a request to the server every time the user types a letter, you can "debounce" the input to wait until the user has stopped typing for a short period before making the request.

```javascript
function debounce(func, delay) {
  let timeoutId;
  return function(...args) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => func.apply(this, args), delay);
  };
}

const handleSearch = debounce(function(event) {
  const query = event.target.value;
  console.log(`Searching for ${query}`);
}, 300);

document.getElementById('searchInput').addEventListener('input', handleSearch);
```

### 5. **Currying**
**Real-Life Example:**
Imagine a scenario in an online store where you apply discounts based on user type (e.g., student, regular, senior citizen) and product category (e.g., electronics, clothing). Currying allows you to create functions that handle this flexibility by partially applying arguments.

```javascript
function applyDiscount(userType) {
  return function(category) {
    return function(price) {
      let discount = 0;
      if (userType === 'student') discount += 10;
      if (category === 'electronics') discount += 5;
      return price - (price * discount / 100);
    };
  };
}

const studentDiscount = applyDiscount('student')('electronics');
console.log(studentDiscount(100));  // 85 (15% discount)
```

### 6. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
**Real-Life Example:**
You are managing employees in a company. Each employee has a name, department, and a method to calculate their salary based on hours worked. Object-oriented programming helps model this structure with classes and objects.

```javascript
class Employee {
  constructor(name, department) {
    this.name = name;
    this.department = department;
  }

  calculateSalary(hoursWorked) {
    return hoursWorked * 20; // $20 per hour
  }
}

const emp = new Employee('John', 'Marketing');
console.log(emp.calculateSalary(40));  // 800
```

### 7. **Error Handling**
**Real-Life Example:**
You are working on a ticket booking system where users can book movie tickets. If the seat they choose is unavailable, you need to handle this error gracefully and notify the user.

```javascript
function bookSeat(seatNumber) {
  const availableSeats = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  if (!availableSeats.includes(seatNumber)) {
    throw new Error('Seat not available');
  }
  return 'Seat booked successfully';
}

try {
  console.log(bookSeat(6));  // Throws an error
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.message);  // Output: Seat not available
}
```

### 8. **Local Storage and Session Storage**
**Real-Life Example:**
You want to save user preferences (like dark mode) so that when they visit your website again, their settings persist.

```javascript
// Save preference
localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');

// Get preference
const theme = localStorage.getItem('theme');
console.log(`Current theme: ${theme}`);  // Output: dark
```

### 9. **Array Methods (map, filter, reduce)**
**Real-Life Example:**
You are managing an inventory of products, and you need to:
- Display all product names (`map`),
- Filter products that are in stock (`filter`),
- Calculate the total value of all products (`reduce`).

```javascript
const products = [
  { name: 'Laptop', price: 1000, inStock: true },
  { name: 'Phone', price: 500, inStock: false },
  { name: 'Tablet', price: 300, inStock: true },
];

// Map: Get product names
const productNames = products.map(product => product.name);
console.log(productNames);  // ['Laptop', 'Phone', 'Tablet']

// Filter: Get in-stock products
const inStockProducts = products.filter(product => product.inStock);
console.log(inStockProducts);  // [{ name: 'Laptop', ...}, { name: 'Tablet', ...}]

// Reduce: Get total value of products
const totalValue = products.reduce((total, product) => total + product.price, 0);
console.log(totalValue);  // 1800
```

### 10. **Modules and Imports/Exports**
**Real-Life Example:**
You are building a large project and want to organize your code into multiple files (modules) for better readability and maintainability.

```javascript
// In mathOperations.js
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

export function subtract(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}

// In main.js
import { add, subtract } from './mathOperations.js';

console.log(add(5, 3));  // 8
console.log(subtract(5, 3));  // 2
```

By covering these topics with real-life examples, you'll be able to relate abstract JavaScript concepts to practical use cases. Would you like to dive deeper into any specific area?
