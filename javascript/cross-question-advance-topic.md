Here’s how you can handle cross-questions related to the additional JavaScript topics and their real-life examples:

### 1. **Closures**

**Question:**  
*Why use closures instead of a simple object to track account balance?*

**Answer:**  
Closures keep the balance private and prevent external modification, ensuring that only the provided methods (deposit, withdraw) can change it. An object would expose the balance directly, allowing unintended modifications.

### 2. **Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises and Async/Await)**

**Question:**  
*Why use `async/await` instead of just using Promises with `.then()`?*

**Answer:**  
`async/await` makes asynchronous code look synchronous, which improves readability and helps in avoiding deeply nested `.then()` calls (callback hell). It’s especially useful when multiple async operations depend on each other.

### 3. **Event Handling**

**Question:**  
*Why use `preventDefault()` for the form submission?*

**Answer:**  
`preventDefault()` stops the default form submission, giving me the chance to validate the data before it's sent. If there are issues (like a missing name), I can stop the form from submitting and notify the user to fix the input.

### 4. **Debouncing**

**Question:**  
*Why debounce the input rather than immediately search after every keystroke?*

**Answer:**  
Without debouncing, every keystroke would trigger a network request, leading to excessive server load and slower performance. Debouncing waits until the user stops typing, reducing unnecessary requests and improving efficiency.

### 5. **Currying**

**Question:**  
*Why use currying here instead of passing all arguments in one function?*

**Answer:**  
Currying breaks down a function with multiple arguments into multiple smaller functions, making the logic reusable. For instance, if I have a fixed user type (e.g., student), I can reuse that part of the function and just pass different categories or prices later.

### 6. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

**Question:**  
*Why not use plain objects instead of classes to define employees?*

**Answer:**  
Using classes makes the code more structured, especially when dealing with similar types of objects (like employees). It also allows for inheritance and better reusability of methods like `calculateSalary`. Plain objects would make the code harder to maintain if the application grows.

---

### 7. **Error Handling**

**Question:**  
*Why throw errors instead of returning a default message or value?*

**Answer:**  
Throwing errors explicitly helps in catching issues where they occur and handling them properly. Returning a default value might silently mask the problem, making debugging harder. Errors should be caught and logged to notify the user or developer of what went wrong.

---

### 8. **Local Storage and Session Storage**

**Question:**  
*What’s the difference between local storage and session storage, and when would you use each?*

**Answer:**  
Local storage persists data across browser sessions, while session storage is cleared when the browser or tab is closed. Use local storage for long-term preferences (like themes) and session storage for temporary data (like the current session's login status).

---

### 9. **Array Methods (map, filter, reduce)**

**Question:**  
*Why use `reduce()` instead of a simple loop to calculate the total value?*

**Answer:**  
`reduce()` is part of functional programming and provides a cleaner, more declarative way to handle operations like summing values. While a loop could also sum values, `reduce()` reduces the amount of code and integrates more naturally into modern JavaScript patterns.

---

### 10. **Modules and Imports/Exports**

**Question:**  
*Why split the code into multiple modules when I could write everything in one file?*

**Answer:**  
Splitting code into modules makes it more maintainable and scalable, especially as the project grows. It also allows for code reuse and easier debugging. Large files become harder to manage and can lead to problems like duplicated logic.

### General Tips for Handling Cross-Questions:
1. **Be Prepared with Trade-offs**: When explaining a solution, always be ready to discuss potential trade-offs. For instance, closures are great for privacy but may use more memory than simple objects.
2. **Compare Alternatives**: Offer alternatives and explain why you chose one over the other.
3. **Simplify with Real-life Scenarios**: Make your answers relatable by linking them back to real-world applications.
4. **Acknowledge Optimization Concerns**: Mention performance implications when relevant, especially with topics like recursion, promises, or loops.
