Excel vs Database

Excel
Easy to use untrained person can work
Data stored less data
good for one time analysis, quick charts
No data integrity due to manual operation
Low search filter capabilities

DataBase
Tanied person can work
Store large amount of data
Can automate task
High data integrity
High Search filter capibilities


SQL DataBase Structure is Relational Data Base Management System

RDBMS (Databse > table >Data > row column)

Data Base Diagram - it's make before creating data base 


Data Types: 
Data Types of a column defines what value the column can store in table
Defined while creating tables in database
Data types mainly classified into three categories most used
	String: char, varchar etc,
	Numeric: int, float, bool etc,
	Date and Time : date, datetime etc,



Commonly used data types in Sql:
int :used for the integer value,
float: used to specify a decimal point number
bool:used to specify Boolean values true and false
char:fixed length string that can contain numbers, letters, and special characters
Carchar : variable length string that can contain numbers, letters and special characters 
data ; date formate yyyyy-mm-dd
datatime:date3 and time combination, format is yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss


Primary and Foreign Keys:

Primary key :
A primary key is a unique column we set in a table to easily identify and locate data in queries
A table can have only one primary key, which should be unique and NOT NULL
Foreign Keys (FK):
A foreign key is a column used to link two or more tables  together 
A table can have any number of foreign keys, can contain duplicate and NULL values

Constraints
Constraints are used to specify rules for data in a table
This ensures the acuuracy and reliability of the data in the table
Constraints can be specified when the table is created with the create Table statement or 
After the table is created with the ALTER TABLE statement 
Suntax CREATE TABLE table_name(
	column1 datatype constraint,
	column2 datatype constraint,
	column3 datatype constraint,
)

Constraints commonly used in SQL:
NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
PRIMARY KEY - A COMBINATION OF A NOT NULL and UNIQUE
FOREIGN KEY - Prevents action that would destroy link between tables (used to link multiple tables together)
CHECK - Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition
DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column if no value is specific
CREATE INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the data very quickly


Creating Data Base Table in SQL :

The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table in a database 

Syntax
	CREATE TABLE table_name(
		column_name1 datatype constraint,
		column_name2 datatype constraint,
		column_name3 datatype constraint,
	)

Example 
	CREATE TABLE customer(
		"ID" int8 PRIMARY KEY,
		"Name" varchar(50) NOT NULL,
		"Age" int NOT NULL,
		"City" char(50),
		"Salary" numeric
	);


Insert Values in table
The insert INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table

Syntax :
INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME
(column1, column2, column3 ..column)
VALUES
(value1,value2,value3,...valueN);

Example 
INSERT INTO customer
(CustID, CustName, Age, City, Salary)
VALUES
(1,'Sam', 26, 'Delhi',9000),
(2,"Ram", 79 "Banglore",10000),
(3, "Ashu", 27 "Jaipur", 20000),
(4, "Ruby", 32 "Lucknow", 250000);

To check data in table 
SELECT * FROM customer

Update value in table
The UPDATE COMMAND IS USED TO UPDATE EXISTING ROWS in a table

UPDATE TABLE_NAME
SET "Column_name1" = 'value1', "Column_name2" = 'value2'
WHERE "ID" = 'value';

Example 
UPDATE customer 
SET CustName ='Xam', Age =32
WHERE CustId =4;

TO CHECK UPDATED TABLE VALUE

SELECT * FROM customer

Delete Values in table 
the delete statement is used to delete existing records in a table

Syntax
DELETE FROM customer
WHERE CustID =3;


Altered Table : The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table

Alter Table - ADD Coulumn Syntax
	ALTER TABLE table_name
	ADD OLUMN column_name;

ALTER TABLE - DROP COLUMN Syntax
	ALTER TABLE table_name
	DROP COLUMN column_name;
ALTER TABLE - ALTER/MODIFY COLUMN Syntax
	ALTER TABLE table_name
	ALTER COLUMN column name datatype

Drop & Truncate Table 

The DROP TABLE command deletes a table in the database 
Syntax 
DROP TABLE table_name;
The TURNCATE TABLE command deletes the data inside a table, but not the table itself

Syntax 
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name


SELECT Statement
the SELECT statement is used to select data from a database
Syntax 
SELECT column_name FROM table_name
To select all the fields available in the table 
Syntax 
	SELECT * FROM table_name

To select distinct/unique fields available in the table 

SELECT DISTINCT Column_name From table_name


WHERE Clause 
The WHERE clause is used to filter records 
it is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specific condtion
SELECT column_name FROM table_name
WHERE conditions;

Example
SELECT name FROM classroom
WHERE grade ='A'


Operators in SQL
The SQL reserved words and characters are called operators, which are used with a WHERE clause in a SQL query

Most used operators:
1- Arithmetic operators:airthmetic operations on numeric values
esample :addition(+), Substraction(-), multiplication(*), Division(/), Modulus(%)
2-Comparision operators :compare two different data of SQL table 
example Equal(=), Not Equal(!=), Greater Than(>), Greater Than Equals(>=)
3- Logical Operators: perform the Boolean operations
example :ALL, IN,BETWEEN,LIKE,AND,OR,NOT, ANY
4- Bitwise operators:perform the bit operations on the 
eample :Bitwise AND(&), Bitwise OR(|)

In WHERE clause there is two other clause
LIMIT Clause and ORDER BY clasue

The LIMIT clause is used to set an upper limit on the number of tuples return by SQL

Example below code will return 5 rows of data
SELECT column_name FROM table_name
LIMIT 5;

the ORDER BY is used to sort the result set in ascending(ASC) or desending order (DESC)
Example : Below code will sort the output data by column name in assending order 

SELECT column_name FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name ASC.

Import csv file into table

COPY table_name(column1, column2, ......columnN)
FROM 'source path of the file'
DELIMITER ',' // for csv
CSV HEADER;
